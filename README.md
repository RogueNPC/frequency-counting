Welcome to Word Frequency Counter!

By utilizing hash tables with chaining to handle collisions, this program will count the number of occurrences of each word in a txt file and print all of the words and their frequencies.  It will also print the total number of distinct words and offer the user a prompt to query the exact count of a particular word in the file.

This project was coded using Python 3.7.9.
